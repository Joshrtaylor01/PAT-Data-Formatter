Following directions requrie PyInstaller to be installed on system.
This guide assumes some knowledge of this program
Further documenation can be found at https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html
This can be used if you wish to edit the source code and rebuild an executable with more optimization


Note:
Two version of the code exist. 
main.py includes no output to the terminal and is most likely what majority of end users will want.
main-verbose.py does include some basic output stating what is happening, and might be interesting for some.
Because of this, if building main-verbose.py, using the -w option will just create a slightly larger and slower file for no real gain

Create a single file executable
pyinstaller -F -w --clean -n PAT-Formatter main.py
pyinstaller -F --clean -n PAT-Formatter main-verbose.py


If UPX is installed may have to specify path as sometimes it doesn't automatically search your $PATH
pyinstaller -F --upx-dir path/to/upx/ -w -n PAT-Formatter main.py

Some optimisation can be made using the following command, not sure how much it does but makes the file smaller
python -O -m PyInstaller -F --upx-dir path/to/upx -w -n PAT-Formatter main.py
